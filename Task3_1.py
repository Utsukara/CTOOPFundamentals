# Task 1: Public Transportation Module

# Problem Statement: Develop a Bus class as part of a public transportation module. Use class variables to represent common attributes like city name and base fare. Implement instance variables for specific attributes like route number and passenger capacity.
# Expected Outcome: A Bus class with both class and instance variables, and a transportation module to manage different bus routes. A test script should demonstrate creating bus instances and accessing both class and instance attributes.
