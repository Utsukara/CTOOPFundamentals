# Task 1: File Handling for Building Records

# Problem Statement: Implement a system to handle building records using file operations. Create a Building class and write a script to save and load building details to and from a file.
# Code Example: Skeleton of the Building class.
# class Building:
#     def __init__(self, name, floors):
#         self.name = name
#         self.floors = floors
#     # Methods to save to file and load from file
# Expected Outcome: A complete Building class with methods for saving to and loading details from a file. A script demonstrating saving multiple buildings to a file and then reading them back into the program.
